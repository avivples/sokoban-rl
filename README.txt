I have 2 notebooks:

	- sokoban-image: experiments with the states as RGB images
	- sokoban-raw: experiments with the states as the raw arrays

All of the cells running the experiments are skipped.

By running all of the cells in each notebook, you will be able to see all of the results and videos, and I provided links to all of my experiments in mlflow.
